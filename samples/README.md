#samples
PUT YOUR SAMPLES HERE:
You can input any .wav or .aiff audio sample you want (defaults to wav), as long as you:
1. Put all your samples in the "sample" folder.
2. Rename all files with the same name (e.g, "your_sample") and with increasing indices (e.g, "your_sample-1", "your_sample-2" ... your_sample-33") 
*NOTE: the dash (-) is very important.*
3. Samples over 90 seconds will be read up to 90 seconds.
